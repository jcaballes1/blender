Is there a reason why when dropping a color from one place to another doesnt preserve the Alpaha? Code does this on purpose /* keep alpha channel as-is */

Is it intended behaviour that color properties in a UIList do not show up as buttons/previews?

Bastien Hi there, the module page said you are responsible for the blend file reading. Maybe you know more about the behaviour that Blender 3.0 is showing.
If I load blender via CLI blender-3.0.0-alpha+master.439c9b0b8478-linux.x86_64-release/blender it is NOT reading the userpref.blend
Is that a bug or is it intended?
(Blender 2.93 is reading the userpref)
On Linux (WSL2, Ubuntu)


Bastien @mont29
05:03
Raimund58 you need a 3.0 folder in your ~/.config/blender, when loading through UI the first time it proposes you to copy over your settings from previous blender version, otherwise you need to do it manually üòâ

Some of these seems reasonable, best move them to tasks if developers have time to work on them.
Although it seems like mix of feature requests and changes.
Suggest to split out your suggestions to change recently added features. You might be better off talking to the developers directly. As lists of suggestions tend to get lost in the noise.
Note that for T91998 I'm mostly concerned with basics - (delete, select all... etc).

Hey Brecht Van Lommel and Sergey , whenever you have time, I would love to hear your thoughts on this: devtalk.blender.org/t/cycles-x-feedback/18598/856
TL/DR: the denoising depth pass has been removed after the Cycles X merger, and it was a crucial part in our/the compositing workflow of mist through refraction heavy scenes. We were planning on rendering our current project with Cycles X and enjoy all the crazy improvements you have implemented but this is now the one feature holding us back. I am not sure if there are any equivalents or workarounds you know of, or if the pass can be brought back or if it was tied to intrinsically to the NLM. Thanks for all your work!


Peter Baintner @pred
07:02
Mario Hawat I am working on a big project where I had lots of issues in this direction. TL;DR is I think using the mist pass is the only good alternative.


IyadAhmed @IyadAhmed

Any pointers are appreciated

Wednesday 7:01 PM
why in 2.80 motion blur works in viewport, code wise ofc ?


Peter Baintner @pred
07:05
Mario Hawat oh nvmd - I overlooked the fact that refratction is a requirement. But now I'm curious - isn't the denoising depth pass super noisy?


Mario Hawat @Kyraneth
07:11
Peter Baintner The denoising depth pass actually comes out surprisingly clean (not sure how). It's an incredibly useful pass, beyond its denoising origins. I'm not sure if I can wrangle the normal Depth or Mist passes to do something like that, but for now I don't see any equivalent to it other than doing computationally expensive render layers or overrides. I am not sure we can get it via AOV even (I would love to be corrected)


Peter Baintner @pred
08:00
Mario Hawat nice! AOV might work, if you take a separate pass and put that material on every object that's not transparent and take something like the ray length as an input?


Sergey @Sergey

JosephEagar Hi. Please follow our guidelines for style in both code and commit messages:
- wiki.blender.org/wiki/Process/Revert_Commit
- wiki.blender.org/wiki/Style_Guide/Commit_Messages


JosephEagar @JosephEagar
08:26
I actually did read through the last 5 commits to try and copy the style üôÇ
So. . .


dfelinto @dfelinto
08:36
JosephEagar it helps to indicate which commit you are reverting
and for both the fix and the revert, it is important to make it clear how to reproduce the issue
(or refer to a bug report)
Luckily you were the one that spotted the issue with your original commit
but if it was someone else that person wouldn't even know how to check if your assumptions were correct


JosephEagar @JosephEagar
08:37
You're right I didn't indicate which commit I was reverting, sorry about that it's a bit early in the morning here.


dfelinto @dfelinto
08:38
that aside there is indeed some tweaks in the message to fit within the style (separate title e.g., from commit message)


JulianEisel @julianeisel
08:39
This guideline is the most important to me here:
 The reason to revert is to be stated explicitly in the revert commit message.
In the past people commonly reverted stuff without ever mentioning a reason.


JosephEagar @JosephEagar
08:40
Heh. Just reading my commit message, man am I tired. That's terrible.
Sorry about that.


Sergey @Sergey
08:44
Mario Hawat That's an interesting topic. Don't have an immediate answer atm, but AOV might work
JosephEagar Imagine someone else digging that piece of code, possibly in a long time from now. Or, even future you. Good luck remembering what the bug, how to repro. Or even seeing "not a bug?". Like, whaat?

Mario Hawat @Kyraneth
09:27
Thank you for your reply Sergey ! I'll try my hand at doing it with an AOV, if it works it still means and extra render layer/render time (and some development time to build a script to include it into all our production files), but at least we won't have to constantly revert to 2.93 for rendering. It would be great to see this pass back in some way shape or form üôÇ


Sergey @Sergey

Mario Hawat The denoising depth will also costs render time though

dfelinto yep, totally overkill. We could avoid that by having the breadcrumbs more prominent (e.g. top-left instead of bottom-left)


dfelinto @dfelinto

Antonioya you can use autopep8 --line-limit=120 (or similar forgot the syntax)

Hi Blendify please remember to setup your IDE to use clang-format (or run make format manually). 82f0e4948c (cleaned here: 0f58cc15943e) üôÇ

LazyDodo @LazyDodo

it doesn't run format all the time, by default only on certain events like code paste, the format on save addon can be installed for more frequent formatting


CharlieJolly @CharlieJolly

It doesn't seem to like the UI python files though. I save a py and then have to undo the formatting. Not really looked at fixing it.


Mario Hawat @Kyraneth
10:45
Sergey , indeed, but I would assume much less time (the Denoising Depth pass really takes just a few milliseconds from my tests), and more importantly much lighter setup than a custom AOV, overrides and a separate render layer to be re-composited (especially on a larger project, much less complexity to deal with and carry over to rendering on hundreds of files). Speaking of AOVs, I am not really sure how to/haven't been successful in emulating this pass with a custom AOV. Would you or Peter Baintner have any idea as to how to go about it?

When trying to follow the developments of a module, and patches are committed without review and without module tag, it make checking for introduced bugs, close to impossible. Could BF devs be reminded of module tagging their commits?

To use blender on my intel gpu w/ 2.92.1 on Linux, i used to have to rebuild blender with llvm disabled (the intel-opencl driver embeds llvm, which was namespace colliding with blenders'). With 2.93.4, it looks like I can use it successfully with llvm enabled in blender -- but before I switch all my machines to that I wanted to see if the issue was intentionally fixed, or if it just randomly started working (and might start failing again) I see developer.blender.org/T68052 mentions the issue, but doesn't call out that it was resolved. I guess I would also like to verify I re-enabled llvm correctly in my build -- is there an easy way to check that?

something is funny with read_homefile operator
and possibly open mainfile in this use case

when the operator is executed from UI Panel in 3D Viewport, and a popup is not invoked, e.g when file is not dirty, or when calling inside another operator with "EXEC_DEFAULT"

the window only catches the mouse press event, and not release, so it invokes for example the box select operator in the newly opened file, or what ever is assigned to left click

here's code for you to try, execute the button twice in a row, under view3d Misc category

import bpy
class Foo(bpy.types.Panel):
    bl_label = "General"
    bl_region_type = "UI"
    bl_space_type = "VIEW_3D"

    def draw(self, context):
        op = self.layout.operator("wm.read_homefile")
        op.load_ui=False
        op.use_empty=True


bpy.utils.register_class(Foo)



the only way I found to fix this is to simulate mouse-left-release right before calling

....
# simulate mouse left release here
bpy.ops.wm.read_homefile(load_ui=False, use_empty=True)
....


but I cannot use event_simulate without enabling it in command line args docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/command_line/arguments.html#misc-options

which is not very convenient as it would be used in a user addon
I used a 3rd party module to simulate mouse events, it worked, but that solution is not perfect too, considering support for multiple platforms


can someone help with this?, I suppose this is something that should be edited in Blender source, but still I want to understand the issue more

thanks in advance

So the way in which blender manages dependencies is with an SVN repo
And the make script is responsible for sync and copy files to build path right?
something is funny with read_homefile operator and possibly open mainfile in this use case when the operator is executed from UI Panel in 3D Viewport, and a popup is not invoked, e.g when file is not dirty, or when calling inside another operator with "EXEC_DEFAULT" the window only catches the mouse press event, and not release, so it invokes for example the box select operator in the newly opened file, or what ever is assigned to left click here's code for you to try, execute the button twice in a row, under view3d Misc category import bpy class Foo(bpy.types.Panel): bl_label = "General" bl_region_type = "UI" bl_space_type = "VIEW_3D" def draw(self, context): op = self.layout.operator("wm.read_homefile") op.load_ui=False op.use_empty=True bpy.utils.register_class(Foo) the only way I found to fix this is to simulate mouse-left-release right before calling .... simulate mouse left release here bpy.ops.wm.read_homefile(load_ui=False, use_empty=True) .... but I cannot use event_simulate without enabling it in command line args https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/command_line/arguments.html#misc-options which is not very convenient as it would be used in a user addon I used a 3rd party module to simulate mouse events, it worked, but that solution is not perfect too, considering support for multiple platforms can someone help with this?, I suppose this is something that should be edited in Blender source, but still I want to understand the issue more thanks in advance


any idea? Harleya

HowardTrickey you can directly link to a branch build like this https://builder.blender.org/download/experimental/soc-2020-io-performance/ , if you're on the main page at https://builder.blender.org/download/experimental/ you can find the individual links hiding under the # at the right hand side of a build


HowardTrickey @HowardTrickey
19:54
Thanks. I thought I'd have to put links for each architecture and didn't feel like doing that. Thought it was obvious enough what to do if you got to the download page.


LazyDodo @LazyDodo
22:22
dfelinto you may need to do some more cleanup, the green overlay color for node groups is still in the theming UI/XML


Hans Goudey @HooglyBoogly
22:38
Well, it still changes the color of the node header


LazyDodo @LazyDodo
22:50
well, darn! I swear my grep for TH_NODE_GROUP came up empty earlier üôÇ


Hans Goudey @HooglyBoogly
22:55
That said, coloring all node groups the same color isn't really very flexible


LazyDodo @LazyDodo
23:06
Hans Goudey available for a "is it just me test?"


Hans Goudey @HooglyBoogly
23:06
Sure, what's up?


LazyDodo @LazyDodo
23:07
open up a node editor (any) pop in a random node, and collapse it with the little triangle in the upper left, now expand it again, life's great
now use the mouse wheel to zoom in as far as it'll go and try again
i can't expand it by hitting the triangle, i have to hit it just right of it near the label


Hans Goudey @HooglyBoogly
23:10
Hmm, I have to click the very right side of the triangle
It clearly doesn't take the zoom into account correctly


LazyDodo @LazyDodo
23:11
collapse works fine though


Hans Goudey @HooglyBoogly
23:11
Yeah, the collapsed and un-collapsed state are built by two completely different functions, so that's not so surprising
I'd like to clean up the drawing code for nodes

is double checking the facts

ideasman42 msgbus question: do the subscriptions to general types, so for example bpy.msgbus.subscribe_rna(key=(bpy.types.FileAssetSelectParams, "asset_library_ref"), ...), survive a blend file loading? Or do I need to re-subscribe when a file is loaded?


ideasman42 @ideasman42
06:57
dr.sybren if they are persistent yes. (options={'PERSISTANT'})


dr.sybren @dr.sybren
06:58
ideasman42 that's not what is documented, though -- there it says when set, the subscriber will be kept when remapping ID data
It doesn't mention file reloads.


ideasman42 @ideasman42
06:58
Checking...


dfelinto @dfelinto
07:01
pablovazquez I think we need to also brighten the Layout > Frames as well
otherwise they stand out too much when we brighten the background of the nodetree


ideasman42 @ideasman42
07:02
dr.sybren ah, they will be freed. This can be supported though. in the case of subscription to types.
A workaround would be to add a file-load handler.


dr.sybren @dr.sybren
07:03
yeah, support for this would be appreciated, but it's not too hard to just add a file-load handler.
for now I'll at least add the "subscriptions are freed on file load" to the documentation üòâ

ideasman42 I've seen you fixing some crashes like that.
ideasman42 does that crash gives you any clues?

09:42
dfelinto How long has this been happening for?


Sergey @Sergey
09:45
dfelinto maybe get you a release build with debug symbols and make you click around while running from gdb?


dfelinto @dfelinto
09:47
ideasman42 I started noticing it this week I think


ideasman42 @ideasman42
09:47
Run with ASAN too, gives useful info and crashes more often.


dfelinto @dfelinto
09:47
it happened at least hm 4 times to me this week
I run into those when developing. So usually I do make lite üòï
could get faster computer and stop using make lite


ideasman42 @ideasman42
09:48
you can do make debug lite
dfelinto surprised I didn't hit this too then, I've been doing things which I would expect to notice this issue (and running with ASAN). Is this only ever happening with tooltips? (possibly I'm not triggering those as much)


dfelinto @dfelinto
09:49
next week ... I will try to run asan here and click around

10:10
dfelinto just in case this description makes it into the commit message, suit->suite


Hans Goudey @HooglyBoogly
10:11
More nitpicking: The commit should probably say "because of an empty tree path" or something, I don't think the file it references is available outside the studio


dfelinto @dfelinto
10:11
right which is what I'm trying to figure out
I couldn't reproduce from scratch though


Hans Goudey @HooglyBoogly
10:11
It is weird to have an empty tree path, I wouldn't expect that
But it's saved in files, so it might be gone for who knows what reason (that doesn't even have anything to do with current code), and we can't really control that in a saved file

The old code was inside a check for if (snode->treepath.last) {, which is why it was not checking for path before doing path->prev. But since I moved the loop code before that (when drawing the background color) the bug sneaked in
anyways next time: code review, code review, code review

Gilberto.R @Gilberto.R
12:50
hello, I'm trying to submit my first diff, but it involves some icon changes, and idk how to upload the .dat files generated by the blender_icons_update.py. D12789


LazyDodo @LazyDodo
12:57
not my area, but i suppose if they are generated, you don't have to include them?


Gilberto.R @Gilberto.R
13:01
I don't think so because we have to generate them by running that script before building


LazyDodo @LazyDodo
13:03
patch seems to have plenty of .dat files, is it just the new ones that are missing?


Gilberto.R @Gilberto.R
13:03
the git diff only mentions that .dat binary file differs, but doesn't include the changes, so if you try to apply it there will be an error for each .dat file


LazyDodo @LazyDodo
13:05
i'd take them out and make generating new dats a problem for whomever gets to land it


Gilberto.R @Gilberto.R
13:06
lol


LazyDodo @LazyDodo
13:07
you could try arcanist for submitting the patch, but i'll admit, we're at the throwing shi..stuff at the wall phase of problem solving


Gilberto.R @Gilberto.R
13:07
and for some reason, if you just run the script now there will be changes to the "Boid icon". so the svg is not in sync with the current icon


LazyDodo @LazyDodo
13:08
can't really help that much, usually when i see a UI patch, i hiss and run in the other direction

ok, I'll try setting up arcanist


LazyDodo @LazyDodo
13:09
heh.. you're in for a world of fun... wait no.. pain.. yeah.. thats it a world of pain , setting up arcanist is... challenging


Gilberto.R @Gilberto.R
13:09
no problem, I will do anything for blender


LazyDodo @LazyDodo
13:10
after you install arcanist, be sure to manually make this change : lists.blender.org/pipermail/bf-committers/2021-October/051169.html


Gilberto.R @Gilberto.R
13:10
alright


ThomasDinges @ThomasDinges
13:13
As a workaround you can also just upload the .dats inside a .zip file and attach them to the patch on the website


LazyDodo @LazyDodo
13:13
given it's already out of sync, and they are generated , why bother with them?

jaggz @jaggz
14:58
should I post this type of basic thing as an issue: "Could NOT find Zstd (missing: ZSTD_INCLUDE_DIR)"
(make after make update causes it in my debian system)
(unfortunately, libzstd-dev is actually installed too)


jaggz @jaggz
15:11
Also: build_linux/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp/src.cxx:1:10: fatal error: arm_neon.h: No such file or directory
Not sure why it's looking for an arm header. packages.debian.org/search?mode=path&suite=bullseye&section=all&arch=any&searchon=contents&keywords=arm_neon.h


LazyDodo @LazyDodo
15:37
it's checking for neon support, which can fail, it's part of the test
it shoudn't stop cmake from wokring


jaggz @jaggz
18:47
LazyDodo ahh, thanks. Yeah that's in the cmake error log. The zstd error is output from make though, to console, and results in a Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!


Ruthie @Ruthie
18:47
Can one of you guys help out in #support ?


jaggz @jaggz
18:48
and that's kinda messed up, since that seems like it's the system cmake files failing: CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-3.16/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:146 (message): Could NOT find Zstd (missing: ZSTD_INCLUDE_DIR)


jaggz @jaggz
19:14
Wait, it's not, that ends up being our own build_files/cmake/Modules/FindZstd.cmake:55
and, while I'm not familiar with this, I think it's supposed to be trying to build it itself, not failing if it can't find it on the system? ./build_files/build_environment/cmake/zstd.cmake


jaggz @jaggz
20:55
Whenever someone's around who might know this, I'd appreciate it. My last build from a couple months ago is segfaulting when rendering out a video, and I wanted to test a fresh pull (so now I'm stuck with a broken build). :}


LazyDodo @LazyDodo
21:03
jaggz the dep got added recently, i'd make sure your svn libs are up to date, and try starting with a new build folder


jaggz @jaggz
21:09
LazyDodo I did make update; that should update okay right? I moved build_linux out of the way beforehand too.
trying a make deps now


deadpin @deadpin
21:22
jaggz bog standard ubuntu seems ok here (cmake step at least)? If you're going to use the precompiled libraries you don't have to make deps your own.


jaggz @jaggz
21:23
deadpin debian stable here. I was using the precompiled and just relying on "make update" to grab'em, but was still getting this error (and see no zstd in the tree except the cmake-related files... and blenlib/intern/filereader_zstd.c)
the system ones are installed in debian too (libzstd1 and libzstd-dev), but it doesn't find those (or isn't looking for them)


deadpin @deadpin
21:24
cmake should say something very similar to: Found Zstd: /home/jesse/blender-git/lib/linux_centos7_x86_64/zstd/lib/libzstd.a 
if you go inside your linux_centos7_x86_64 dir and manually svn update, maybe that will yield some clues too (should be at revision 62717)


jaggz @jaggz
22:38
deadpin thanks for the help. My dir is Mar 19 2021 lib/linux_x86_64/ with no zstd/ in it. I'm getting the centos ones now.


jaggz @jaggz

hello!
I am new to blender source. and wanted to learn about blender development.
I wanted to ask how can disable some build Configuration and features before building blender.
compilation takes too long for so I want to disable most of build options. I am on windows and using cmake/ninja.


PratikPB2125 @PratikPB2125
08:08
Hi QLavi , did you check wiki.blender.org/wiki/Building_Blender/Options#Setup_For_Developers ?
 so I want to disable most of build options.
May be you can use "lite" build or disable parameters from CMakeCache.txt
You can always ask build related questions on #blender-builds üôÇ


QLavi @qlavi
08:10
oh alright.
I also found how to disable options I didn't check cmake-gui before üòÖ

I'm trying to shear an object via its transforms. I figured I might just be able to apply the matrix I want, for example 
import bpy
testObj = bpy.data.objects['matrix edit test']


defMatrix = ((1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), 
             (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0),
             (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0),
             (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0))
             

shearMatrix =  ((1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), 
             (0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0),
             (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0),
             (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0))
             
testObj.matrix_local = shearMatrix


but that doesn't work because blender automatically recalculates it to get rid of my shear, and I end up with 
>>> testObj.matrix_local
Matrix(((0.9739694595336914, 0.2534351050853729, 0.0, 0.0),
        (-0.2266792356967926, 1.0889309644699097, 0.0, 0.0),
        (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0),
        (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)))


Any idea if what I'm trying to achieve is possible? And if so how would I go about it?
It's definitely possible to shear objects using a stack of transforms - here's an example, but as you can see it's a pretty unweildy way of doing it!

jaggz @jaggz

Df you should probably be asking this in #python. blender isn't going to sheer your object through just an assignment of that matrix though -- you'd need to apply the transform to its data i think


jaggz @jaggz
11:54
@df I don't know what blender does to normalize the data, but it's likely doing it so the matrix is storing loc,rot,scale (not a full set of affine transformations).

Pedro @povmaniac
13:42
Hi Thomas!


Df @Df
13:42
Thanks jaggz - yeah it does seem like you're right, it's normalizing it so it only contains loc,rot,scale - I was just hoping there was a way of doing shears without modifying the vertex data, because that won't work for Collection Instances etc, but it does seem like shears aren't directly allowed (for whatever reason!). Will ask in #Python, cheers!


LazyDodo @LazyDodo
14:40
ThomasDinges yes...but...., why?
you can do them and run the tests, but we should never make a debug windows build available to users, they can't run it

svenstaro @svenstaro

Hey, I'm the Arch package maintainer for Blender. I received this bug report and it's apparently a problem only in our package: bugs.archlinux.org/task/72352 However, we don't use any fancy build options and, in fact, use the official build config: github.com/archlinux/svntogit-community/blob/packages/blender/trunk/PKGBUILD#L59. Does anyone have a hunch what might be up in the package here?

Obviously we want to give our users a great experience when using downstream packaged Blender as well.
Only thing I can think of are our more recent dependencies and GCC11 which we use


ideasman42 @ideasman42
21:59
svenstaro hey, This kind of report better go via Blender's bug tracker.


deadpin @deadpin
22:01
Looks like it was already filed as developer.blender.org/T89206 before. But closed (official packages were fine as verified by original reporter as well)


ideasman42 @ideasman42
22:03
Yes, reading into this...


svenstaro @svenstaro
22:03
I mean I get that you guys don't really wanna look into downstream problems but we're really trying to follow upstream builds here as much as we can


ideasman42 @ideasman42
22:04
svenstaro some steps to take then...
- build without patches, following steps on Blenders developer page.
- build with a different compiler (to rule out a certain class of areas) - clang for example.


svenstaro @svenstaro
22:04
We only have the openexr3 patch though currently


ideasman42 @ideasman42
22:04
svenstaro this kind of error is really rare though... am surprised it happens at all.


svenstaro @svenstaro
22:05
using clang is a good idea though I can't build the cuda bits with it, gotta use gcc11 as the host compiler there I figure


ideasman42 @ideasman42
22:05
And often these kinds of errors hint at errors in Blender, even if they only happen on a different build.
Although if this is caused by a difference in a 3rd party library - it's a different story.


svenstaro @svenstaro
22:06
In that case though you guys are bound to hit the problem in the 3rd party libs sooner or later I reckon
since the only difference we have is that ours tend to be more recent


ideasman42 @ideasman42
22:07
Right, you could try building against blender's pre-compiled libs. If that works then it's almost certainly a difference between the libraries.


svenstaro @svenstaro
22:08
I don't think there's any chance they are ABI compatible
I'm currently doing a clang build though


ideasman42 @ideasman42
22:08
They can be used to test though (they work on arch)


svenstaro @svenstaro
22:09
I suppose it's also useful to not use our hardening options
we have some binary hardening options for gcc that we tend to use


jaggz @jaggz
23:03
I forgot how to deal with this: GCC version must be at least 9.3 for precompiled libraries, found 8.3.0
where can we get libs that'll work on debian-stable?


svenstaro @svenstaro
23:24
ideasman42 I figured it out, it's     -DWITH_CYCLES_EMBREE=OFF
so setting that makes it work fine but     -DWITH_CYCLES_EMBREE=ON will break it
Frankly I still consider this an upstream but I'll turn it off in the package for the time being
üëç 1


deadpin @deadpin
23:30
certainly interesting. the x64 packages here use embree 3.10, the mac arm64 uses 3.12.1. What version do you use in arch?


svenstaro @svenstaro
23:31
3.13.0


jaggz @jaggz
23:43
looks like make deps, when it builds meson, doesn't install its dependencies. meson requires 'mako' which isn't installed. It's using my local (miniconda) python 3.7 currently
"meson.build:903:2: ERROR: Problem encountered: Python (3.x) mako module >= 0.8.0 required to build mesa."
Okay.. after manually installing that: paste.debian.net/1215014/
some embree build bug. How do I go manually run that build to get more debug info?
deadpin hola. (Not sure if it's too naggy to highlight you for this)


svenstaro @svenstaro
00:00
deadpin wanna take a look at 3.13.0?


deadpin @deadpin
00:27
jaggz not sure I can help with make deps as i'm not too familiar with that script, esp. since i'm on windows and have never hit an issue with the provided libs. debian stable should be on gcc 10.x now though and/or should have packages to get you to 9.3 at least
svenstaro likewise, I'm not setup to build the libs on my side right now to give it a shot. I've been meaning to but haven't yet.
it's weird that there would be a silent break though.


jaggz @jaggz
00:30
oh shoot. I'm on old-stable now. (as of aug 14th). Ugh. (scared to make this system unusable with an upgrade)


LazyDodo @LazyDodo
01:52
svenstaro if you want to have a stab at figuring out what's wrong, building/running the tests, is always good advise (given you're the package maintainer, i'd always do this when you repackage even if you don't have bug reports on your end, catches them bugs early) however, i'd also try a debug build, asserts are off in release builds, right now you're somswhat in a position where all we can do is "heh weird" if you have a stack trace from an assert more targeted help may be possible.
jaggz i'd probably just look into a way to get gcc9+ , it probably be the solution with the least amount of hassle

Stefan Werner o/ in 9715ad5acad9: macOS: Support arm64 architecture. you add a patch for numpy. Could you maybe elaborate on why these changes were necessary, and where they came from? Neither the commit message nor the patch review discussed this, and after I update numpy the patch no longer applies.


YimingWu @ChengduLittleA
05:53
Oh BTW recently my git cli doesn't wait for me to type commit messages.... it pops the editor but the cli already says it exited because the message is empty, does anyone know why this kind of thing happen? It doesn't always happen, but rather randomly


Stefan Werner @StefanWerner
05:53
dr.sybren it was because numpy assumed that any non-intel Mac would use PPC and support altivec


YimingWu @ChengduLittleA
05:53
Could that because some git configuration problem?


Stefan Werner @StefanWerner
05:53
the original numpy was passing -faltivec to the compiler, which fails on ARM
upstream numpy removed that in this commit: github.com/numpy/numpy/commit/516bb1a1faeb4f0c33f2da9a199ecccabb000469#diff-4e9ee9760f2f3e8cd7f2febab1e1813536a815a2078a1b653e3977c9f9e18951
